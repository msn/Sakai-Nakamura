=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl library providing a layer of abstraction to the REST group methods

Sakai Nakamura adds another layer to the traditional
Apache::Sling view of Groups. Rather than just:
Groups -> Members, there now exists:
Groups -> Roles -> Members

Roles are the top level group members, they define what members of
those roles are able to do in the group.

Role members are the actual system users - they get added to a role and
that defines what they are able to do in a group:
