Sakai-Nakamura version 0.06
===========================

Welcome to the Sakai Nakamura library for perl. This library sets out to make it
simple to interact with the skai nakamura web framework from a perl application,
thus making it easier to harness the power of sakai and perl simultaneously!

Sakai Nakamura is built upon Apache Sling. Apache Sling is a web framework that
uses a Java Content Repository, such as Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage
content.

Sakai 3 will be the next major new version of the Sakai software. The kernel
leapfrogs many current-generation architectures for software of its category.
The enhanced functionality of Sakai 3 will include:

    * A revamped user experience
    * A powerful and easy to use content authoring capability
    * Social networking features
    * Improved teaching and learning workflows
    * Increased scalability
    * Ease of use for software developers

Sakai Nakamura.
