Sakai-Nakamura version 0.11
===========================

Welcome to the Sakai Nakamura library for perl. This library sets out to make it
simple to interact with the sakai nakamura web framework from a perl application,
thus making it easier to harness the power of sakai and perl simultaneously!

Sakai Nakamura is built upon Apache Sling. Apache Sling is a web framework that
uses a Java Content Repository, such as Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage
content.

Sakai OAE, built upon Sakai Nakamura, is an open-source platform that promotes
collaboration and sharing between users and interoperability between systems.
It embraces a new vision for academic collaboration informed by the needs of
learners, teachers and researchers.

Academic networking capabilities encourage people to connect and participate
actively in communities that span beyond the traditional boundaries of
classroom and institution. Powerful capabilities around content . creation,
authoring, reuse, presentation, and commenting . permit mash-ups and remixable
experiences of ideas, connectivity, dialog and media. Enhanced search
capabilities aid discovery of people and content. A widget-based architecture
simplifies both development and integration with external systems.
